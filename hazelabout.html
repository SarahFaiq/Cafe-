                <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
                <p>The Hazelnut Factory in Lucknow is a beloved café and dessert destination that began with a simple passion for creating high-quality, handcrafted confections. 
                    Founded in 2014 by Aman Singh, the café started as a boutique bakery offering artisanal chocolates, pastries, and desserts.
                     With its charming European-inspired decor and cozy ambiance, it quickly became a local favorite, attracting dessert lovers from all over the city.</p>

                <p>What set The Hazelnut Factory apart was its dedication to using premium ingredients and crafting every item with precision and creativity. 
                    Signature items like the hazelnut praline cake and Belgian chocolate truffles earned it a loyal customer base. 
                    Over time, the café expanded its menu to include gourmet sandwiches, pizzas, and coffees, evolving into a full-service café while maintaining its dessert legacy.

                </p>
                <p>Located in the upscale area of Hazratganj, the café became more than just a food destination—it turned into a social hub for young professionals, families, and students.
                     The brand's success led to multiple outlets in Lucknow, each maintaining the same quality and warmth.
